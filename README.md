In the future, we might make it possible to track GPS location aswell, not sure if its needed, can be a good idea for example if you as a parent want to track your children, without using services from Apple or Google.

But, this requires the GPS-locations to be end-to-end encrypted, as Stellar Security have no interest in knowing any info.
